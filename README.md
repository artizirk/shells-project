LearnX (Py edition)
=========

It's one LearniX project
I'm doing same thing as one dude, but in python
here's example: RoR vs. Flask/Python


TODO:
- [x] Remove daemon.py cuz it's not multi-threaded
- [ ] Migrate from socket to twistd
- [ ] Add flask frontend #NEEDS FIX
- [ ] Get contributors and/or testers
- [ ] Create html pages for flask
- [ ] Create more functions for flask
